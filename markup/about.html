<h1>About Luminescence</h1>
<p>
  Stranded on a desert planet with nothing but their wits and some really fucking big light cannons, two rival factions battle for control of their (conveniently symmetrical) surroundings, and a chance to survive their plight. Each player controls a set of individual units.
</p>
<p>
  Each player must program his units to coordinate with each other and destroy the enemy. The player who destroys all of his opponent's units wins.
